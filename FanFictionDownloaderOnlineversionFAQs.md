## What is `ApplicationError:` 5? ##
This is a rather undifferentiated error that the application gives for a variety of reasons. (Undifferentiated means it doesn't distinguish between a number of different issues that cause the error).

This often indicates the application was have problems connecting to the fan fiction website.

FFDL tries several times, with longer waits between attempts, when there's a failure to retrieve story data, but sometimes it still fails. Sometimes, the only answer is to try again later.
